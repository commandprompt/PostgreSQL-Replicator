These tests are used to stress test replicator. They are reasonably brutal
and designed to be a foot gun. E.g., the point is to break stuff because
that is what a customer is going to do, break things.

To run the test without updating repo:

starttest.sh

To just build the tests (update the repo):

buildrepo.sh

To stop and report on the tests:

stoptest.sh

To run everything as a single test:

runtest.sh

There are variablies at the top of each file that need to be changed.

You will also need to change the user name in all psql/pgbench calls.
