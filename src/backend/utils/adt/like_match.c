 * like_match.c
 *	  LIKE pattern matching internal code.
 *
 * This file is included by like.c four times, to provide matching code for
 * (1) single-byte encodings, (2) UTF8, (3) other multi-byte encodings,
 * and (4) case insensitive matches in single byte encodings.
 * (UTF8 is a special case because we can use a much more efficient version
 * of NextChar than can be used for general multi-byte encodings.)
 *
 * Before the inclusion, we need to define the following macros:
 *
 * NextChar
 * MatchText - to name of function wanted
 * do_like_escape - name of function if wanted - needs CHAREQ and CopyAdvChar
 * MATCH_LOWER - define iff using to_lower on text chars

 *	Originally written by Rich $alz, mirror!rs, Wed Nov 26 19:03:17 EST 1986.
 *	Rich $alz is now <rsalz@bbn.com>.
 *	Special thanks to Lars Mathiesen <thorinn@diku.dk> for the LABORT code.
 *
 *	This code was shamelessly stolen from the "pql" code by myself and
 *	slightly modified :)
 *
 *	All references to the word "star" were replaced by "percent"
 *	All references to the word "wild" were replaced by "like"
 *
 *	All the nice shell RE matching stuff was replaced by just "_" and "%"
 *
 *	As I don't have a copy of the SQL standard handy I wasn't sure whether
 *	to leave in the '\' escape character handling.
 *
 *	Keith Parks. <keith@mtcc.demon.co.uk>
 *
 *	SQL92 lets you specify the escape character by saying
 *	LIKE <pattern> ESCAPE <escape character>. We are a small operation
 *	so we force you to use '\'. - ay 7/95
 *
 *	Now we have the like_escape() function that converts patterns with
 *	any specified escape character (or none at all) to the internal
 *	default escape character, which is still '\'. - tgl 9/2000
 *
 * The code is rewritten to avoid requiring null-terminated strings,
 * which in turn allows us to leave out some memcpy() operations.
 * This code should be faster and take less memory, but no promises...

 *	Match text and pattern, return LIKE_TRUE, LIKE_FALSE, or LIKE_ABORT.
 *
 *	LIKE_TRUE: they match
 *	LIKE_FALSE: they don't match
 *	LIKE_ABORT: not only don't they match, but the text is too short.
 *
 * If LIKE_ABORT is returned, then no suffix of the text can match the
 * pattern either, so an upper-level % scan can stop scanning now.
