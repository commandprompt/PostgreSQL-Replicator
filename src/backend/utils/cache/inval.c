 *
 * inval.c
 *	  POSTGRES cache invalidation dispatcher code.
 *
 *	This is subtle stuff, so pay attention:
 *
 *	When a tuple is updated or deleted, our standard time qualification rules
 *	consider that it is *still valid* so long as we are in the same command,
 *	ie, until the next CommandCounterIncrement() or transaction commit.
 *	(See utils/time/tqual.c, and note that system catalogs are generally
 *	scanned under SnapshotNow rules by the system, or plain user snapshots
 *	for user queries.)	At the command boundary, the old tuple stops
 *	being valid and the new version, if any, becomes valid.  Therefore,
 *	we cannot simply flush a tuple from the system caches during heap_update()
 *	or heap_delete().  The tuple is still good at that point; what's more,
 *	even if we did flush it, it might be reloaded into the caches by a later
 *	request in the same command.  So the correct behavior is to keep a list
 *	of outdated (updated/deleted) tuples and then do the required cache
 *	flushes at the next command boundary.  We must also keep track of
 *	inserted tuples so that we can flush "negative" cache entries that match
 *	the new tuples; again, that mustn't happen until end of command.
 *
 *	Once we have finished the command, we still need to remember inserted
 *	tuples (including new versions of updated tuples), so that we can flush
 *	them from the caches if we abort the transaction.  Similarly, we'd better
 *	be able to flush "negative" cache entries that may have been loaded in
 *	place of deleted tuples, so we still need the deleted ones too.
 *
 *	If we successfully complete the transaction, we have to broadcast all
 *	these invalidation events to other backends (via the SI message queue)
 *	so that they can flush obsolete entries from their caches.	Note we have
 *	to record the transaction commit before sending SI messages, otherwise
 *	the other backends won't see our updated tuples as good.
 *
 *	When a subtransaction aborts, we can process and discard any events
 *	it has queued.	When a subtransaction commits, we just add its events
 *	to the pending lists of the parent transaction.
 *
 *	In short, we need to remember until xact end every insert or delete
 *	of a tuple that might be in the system caches.	Updates are treated as
 *	two events, delete + insert, for simplicity.  (There are cases where
 *	it'd be possible to record just one event, but we don't currently try.)
 *
 *	We do not need to register EVERY tuple operation in this way, just those
 *	on tuples in relations that have associated catcaches.	We do, however,
 *	have to register every operation on every tuple that *could* be in a
 *	catcache, whether or not it currently is in our cache.	Also, if the
 *	tuple is in a relation that has multiple catcaches, we need to register
 *	an invalidation message for each such catcache.  catcache.c's
 *	PrepareToInvalidateCacheTuple() routine provides the knowledge of which
 *	catcaches may need invalidation for a given tuple.
 *
 *	Also, whenever we see an operation on a pg_class or pg_attribute tuple,
 *	we register a relcache flush operation for the relation described by that
 *	tuple.	pg_class updates trigger an smgr flush operation as well.
 *
 *	We keep the relcache and smgr flush requests in lists separate from the
 *	catcache tuple flush requests.	This allows us to issue all the pending
 *	catcache flushes before we issue relcache flushes, which saves us from
 *	loading a catcache tuple during relcache load only to flush it again
 *	right away.  Also, we avoid queuing multiple relcache flush requests for
 *	the same relation, since a relcache flush is relatively expensive to do.
 *	(XXX is it worth testing likewise for duplicate catcache flush entries?
 *	Probably not.)
 *
 *	If a relcache flush is issued for a system relation that we preload
 *	from the relcache init file, we must also delete the init file so that
 *	it will be rebuilt during the next backend restart.  The actual work of
 *	manipulating the init file is in relcache.c, but we keep track of the
 *	need for it here.
 *
 *	The request lists proper are kept in CurTransactionContext of their
 *	creating (sub)transaction, since they can be forgotten on abort of that
 *	transaction but must be kept till top-level commit otherwise.  For
 *	simplicity we keep the controlling list-of-lists in TopTransactionContext.
