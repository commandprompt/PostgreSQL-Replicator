 *
 * This module maintains an unsorted array of the PGPROC structures for all
 * active backends.  Although there are several uses for this, the principal
 * one is as a means of determining the set of currently running transactions.
 *
 * Because of various subtle race conditions it is critical that a backend
 * hold the correct locks while setting or clearing its MyProc->xid field.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * The process array now also includes PGPROC structures representing
 * prepared transactions.  The xid and subxids fields of these are valid,
 * as are the myProcLocks lists.  They can be distinguished from regular
 * backend PGPROCs at need by checking for pid == 0.
