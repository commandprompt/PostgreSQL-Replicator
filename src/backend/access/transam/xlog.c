/*----------
 * Shared-memory data structures for XLOG control
 *
 * LogwrtRqst indicates a byte position that we need to write and/or fsync
 * the log up to (all records before that point must be written or fsynced).
 * LogwrtResult indicates the byte positions we have already written/fsynced.
 * These structs are identical but are declared separately to indicate their
 * slightly different functions.
 *
 * We do a lot of pushups to minimize the amount of access to lockable
 * shared memory values.  There are actually three shared-memory copies of
 * LogwrtResult, plus one unshared copy in each backend.  Here's how it works:
 *		XLogCtl->LogwrtResult is protected by info_lck
 *		XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult is protected by WALWriteLock
 *		XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult is protected by WALInsertLock
 * One must hold the associated lock to read or write any of these, but
 * of course no lock is needed to read/write the unshared LogwrtResult.
 *
 * XLogCtl->LogwrtResult and XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult are both "always
 * right", since both are updated by a write or flush operation before
 * it releases WALWriteLock.  The point of keeping XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult
 * is that it can be examined/modified by code that already holds WALWriteLock
 * without needing to grab info_lck as well.
 *
 * XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult may lag behind the reality of the other two,
 * but is updated when convenient.	Again, it exists for the convenience of
 * code that is already holding WALInsertLock but not the other locks.
 *
 * The unshared LogwrtResult may lag behind any or all of these, and again
 * is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * Note that this all works because the request and result positions can only
 * advance forward, never back up, and so we can easily determine which of two
 * values is "more up to date".
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALInsertLock: must be held to insert a record into the WAL buffers.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.
 *
 * CheckpointLock: must be held to do a checkpoint or restartpoint (ensures
 * only one checkpointer at a time; currently, with all checkpoints done by
 * the bgwriter, this is just pro forma).
