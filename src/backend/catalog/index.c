	 *
	 * 2. We could be reindexing pg_class itself, in which case we can't move

	 *
	 * 3. Because we execute CREATE INDEX with just share lock on the parent

	 * suffer a tuple-concurrently-updated failure against another CREATE
	 * INDEX committing at about the same time.  We can avoid that by having

	 * creates a race condition as to whether he will see both or neither of
	 * the pg_class row versions as valid.	Again, a non-transactional update
	 * avoids the risk.  It is indeterminate which state of the row the other
	 * process will see, but it doesn't matter (if he's only taking
	 * AccessShareLock, then it's not critical that he see relhasindex true).
	 *
	 * It is safe to use a non-transactional update even though our
	 * transaction could still fail before committing.	Setting relhasindex
	 * true is safe even if there are no indexes (VACUUM will eventually fix
	 * it), and of course the relpages and reltuples counts are correct (or at

/*
 * validate_index - support code for concurrent index builds
 *
 * We do a concurrent index build by first inserting the catalog entry for the
 * index via index_create(), marking it not indisready and not indisvalid.
 * Then we commit our transaction and start a new one, then we wait for all
 * transactions that could have been modifying the table to terminate.	Now
 * we know that any subsequently-started transactions will see the index and
 * honor its constraints on HOT updates; so while existing HOT-chains might
 * be broken with respect to the index, no currently live tuple will have an
 * incompatible HOT update done to it.	We now build the index normally via
 * index_build(), while holding a weak lock that allows concurrent
 * insert/update/delete.  Also, we index only tuples that are valid
 * as of the start of the scan (see IndexBuildHeapScan), whereas a normal
 * build takes care to include recently-dead tuples.  This is OK because
 * we won't mark the index valid until all transactions that might be able
 * to see those tuples are gone.  The reason for doing that is to avoid
 * bogus unique-index failures due to concurrent UPDATEs (we might see
 * different versions of the same row as being valid when we pass over them,
 * if we used HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum).  This leaves us with an index that
 * does not contain any tuples added to the table while we built the index.
 *
 * Next, we mark the index "indisready" (but still not "indisvalid") and
 * commit the second transaction and start a third.  Again we wait for all
 * transactions that could have been modifying the table to terminate.	Now
 * we know that any subsequently-started transactions will see the index and
 * insert their new tuples into it.  We then take a new reference snapshot
 * which is passed to validate_index().  Any tuples that are valid according
 * to this snap, but are not in the index, must be added to the index.
 * (Any tuples committed live after the snap will be inserted into the
 * index by their originating transaction.	Any tuples committed dead before
 * the snap need not be indexed, because we will wait out all transactions
 * that might care about them before we mark the index valid.)
 *
 * validate_index() works by first gathering all the TIDs currently in the
 * index, using a bulkdelete callback that just stores the TIDs and doesn't
 * ever say "delete it".  (This should be faster than a plain indexscan;
 * also, not all index AMs support full-index indexscan.)  Then we sort the
 * TIDs, and finally scan the table doing a "merge join" against the TID list
 * to see which tuples are missing from the index.	Thus we will ensure that
 * all tuples valid according to the reference snapshot are in the index.
 *
 * Building a unique index this way is tricky: we might try to insert a
 * tuple that is already dead or is in process of being deleted, and we
 * mustn't have a uniqueness failure against an updated version of the same
 * row.  We could try to check the tuple to see if it's already dead and tell
 * index_insert() not to do the uniqueness check, but that still leaves us
 * with a race condition against an in-progress update.  To handle that,
 * we expect the index AM to recheck liveness of the to-be-inserted tuple
 * before it declares a uniqueness error.
 *
 * After completing validate_index(), we wait until all transactions that
 * were alive at the time of the reference snapshot are gone; this is
 * necessary to be sure there are none left with a serializable snapshot
 * older than the reference (and hence possibly able to see tuples we did
 * not index).	Then we mark the index "indisvalid" and commit.  Subsequent
 * transactions will be able to use it for queries.
 *
 * Doing two full table scans is a brute-force strategy.  We could try to be
 * cleverer, eg storing new tuples in a special area of the table (perhaps
 * making the table append-only by setting use_fsm).  However that would
 * add yet more locking issues.
