1. Sequence handling may fail on ROLLBACK.  The problem is that replicating
the sequence data requires writing to disk, which could fail when the disk
is full.

2. Replication of oid attribute for tables declared WITH OIDS during creation.
Currently values of that attribute are different on master and on slaves after
replication of these tables.

3. Single point of failure in the forwarder: right now, if the server running
the forwarder crashes, replication is completely stuck.
